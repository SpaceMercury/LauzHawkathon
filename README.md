This project will be for time series forecasting. It aims to develop models and algorithms to predict future values based on historical data.# LauzHawkathon

## Tasks

- [-] **Define the Problem Statement**
  - [ ] Clearly outline the objectives and goals of the forecasting project.
  - [ ] Identify the key metrics for evaluation.

- [ ] **Data Collection**
  - [ ] Gather historical data relevant to the forecasting problem.
  - [ ] Ensure data quality and completeness.

- [ ] **Data Preprocessing**
  - [ ] Handle missing values and outliers.
  - [ ] Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.
  - [ ] Split the data into training and testing sets.

- [ ] **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - [ ] Visualize the data to understand trends, seasonality, and patterns.
  - [ ] Perform statistical analysis to gain insights.

- [ ] **Feature Engineering**
  - [ ] Create new features that may help improve the model's performance.
  - [ ] Select the most relevant features for the model.

- [ ] **Model Selection**
  - [ ] Choose appropriate time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet).
  - [ ] Justify the choice of models based on the problem and data characteristics.

- [ ] **Model Training**
  - [ ] Train the selected models on the training data.
  - [ ] Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

- [ ] **Model Evaluation**
  - [ ] Evaluate the models using the testing data.
  - [ ] Compare model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

- [ ] **Model Deployment**
  - [ ] Deploy the best-performing model to a production environment.
  - [ ] Set up a pipeline for continuous monitoring and updating of the model.

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Document the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation results.
  - [ ] Update the `README.md` file with relevant information and instructions.

- [ ] **Maintenance**
  - [ ] Monitor the model's performance over time.
  - [ ] Update the model as new data becomes available or as the underlying patterns change.
